### Each project file contains structured SQL queries and documentation for easy exploration and learning.

### Overview - SQL_exercises (Joins & Window Functions)

This project is a practical training on SQL queries, focusing on the use of JOINs and window functions. The dataset consists of employee records, including salaries, job titles, and hire dates. The goal was to explore data efficiently using advanced SQL techniques.

ðŸ”‘ **Key Topics Covered**
- JOINs: Practiced different types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) to merge employee, salary, and title data.
- Window Functions: Applied functions like RANK(), NTILE(), and ROW_NUMBER() to analyze salary distributions and hiring trends.
- Aggregations: Used AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), and GROUP BY to calculate key metrics.
- Filtering and Sorting: Leveraged WHERE, ORDER BY, and PARTITION BY for structured data retrieval.

ðŸ“Š **Example Queries**
- Identified the first hired employee for each job title.
- Calculated the average salary per job position.
- Used NTILE() to group employees into salary tiers.

ðŸ“• **Learnings & Challenges**
- Ensured data consistency when using window functions.
- Addressed order dependencies in ranking functions.
- Optimized query performance by refining filtering criteria.
